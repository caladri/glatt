Tasks to do before release:
	o) Start threads and PCPU stuff much earlier to make it possible to use
	   more mutexes than spinlocks, or otherwise enable using mutexes and
	   not spinlocks for a larger number of things.  It would be nice to
	   be able to move to reader/writer locks.
	o) Userland -- start by just copying some instructions out to userland,
	   then move into all of the ELF stuff below.
	o) IPC
		o) Mailbox structure.
		o) System call.
		o) Think more about the rights model and rights passing.
		o) More complete data model.
	o) Simple FS server.
	o) Link files into the kernel to present a MFS.
	   XXX Perhaps UFS read support would be more productive.
	o) ELF loader.
		o) Trivial static ELF loading for servers and such.
		o) Userland ELF loader that can handle static and dynamic.
	o) Memory/interrupt allocation from busses.
	o) Write mu-tune for device hints, perhaps other things.
	o) Clean up VM, pmap and exceptions.  Add vm objects and pv lists?
	o) Simple ethernet stack.
	o) Either implement preemption or declare preemption never.
	o) Timekeeping or defer it.
	o) Simple storage stack.
	o) Determine malloc vs. pool usage.  If something is only going to have
	   a small number of allocations, it should use malloc.  If something
	   cannot use a virtual address it should use a pool without VIRTUAL
	   set.  On the other hand, VIRTUAL pools no longer really exist, and
	   that may be desirable.
	o) Ports for device drivers.
	o) Signal / exception port functionality.

Bugs:
	o) The old core_test.c program with a large number of threads causes a
	   panic seemingly due to reuse of memory or exhaustion of memory, or
	   perhaps due to a write somewhere inappropriate.

Current goal: December 2008 release.
