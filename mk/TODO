Tasks to do before release:
	o) IPC
		o) Mailbox structure.
		o) System call.
	o) Simple FS server.
	o) Link files into the kernel to present a MFS.
	o) ELF loader.
		o) Trivial static ELF loading for servers and such.
		o) Userland ELF loader that can handle static and dynamic.
	o) Memory/interrupt allocation from busses.
	o) Write mu-tune for device hints, perhaps other things.
	o) Clean up VM, pmap and exceptions.  Add vm objects and pv lists?
	o) Simple ethernet stack.
	o) Either implement preemption or declare preemption never.
	o) Timekeeping or defer it.
	o) Simple storage stack.
	o) Determine malloc vs. pool usage.  If something is only going to have
	   a small number of allocations, it should use malloc.  If something
	   cannot use a virtual address it should use a pool without VIRTUAL
	   set.  On the other hand, VIRTUAL pools no longer really exist, and
	   that may be desirable.
	o) Ports for device drivers.
	o) Signal / exception port functionality.

Bugs:
	o) The old core_test.c program with a large number of threads causes a
	   panic seemingly due to reuse of memory or exhaustion of memory, or
	   perhaps due to a write somewhere inappropriate.

Current goal: December 2008 release.
