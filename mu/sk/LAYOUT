build		Build system and tools.
cpu		CPU-specific source and headers.
kernel		Kernel-level source code.
platform	Platform-specific source code and headers.
sk		Shared code between kernel and supervisor (or interfaces between.)
supervisor	Supervisor-level source code.

The system starts running sk initialization code.  This installs the supervisor
and the kernel and starts them each running.  This means telling the supervisor
what memory and CPUs are available, from the bootstrap CPU, and then setting up
the supervisor -- on MIPS this means installing exception handlers that point to
the supervisor.  Each CPU is started by the sk layer, and from there the
supervisor allocates them a chunk of available physical memory and per-CPU
data.  Then, sk tells the kernel to set up its virtual memory system and do
the rest of its startup.
